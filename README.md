# Analyzing Home Energy Use, Demographics, and Solar Potential

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about home energy use, demographics, and solar potential. The dataset includes electricity and gas usage data for houses in a small city in the northeastern part of the USA, along with census data about the neighborhoods. The goal is to understand energy consumption patterns, estimate the potential for solar energy replacement, and analyze demographic factors that might influence these patterns.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

The first step involves loading and preprocessing the data:
- Reading the CSV files.
- Handling missing values.
- Converting data types as necessary.

This step is crucial as the quality of data affects the ability to extract meaningful insights.

### Energy Consumption Analysis

We will analyze the energy consumption of houses per season and time of the day. This includes:
- Aggregating the time series data to calculate total energy usage for different time periods.
- Employing a time series forecasting model such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or deep learning methods like LSTM to predict future energy consumption based on historical data.

### Solar Energy Potential

We will calculate how much of the energy consumption can be replaced by solar energy:
- Using data on hours of sunlight received per year and square footage available for solar panels.
- Estimating how many houses have the roof area to support the required amount of solar panels.
- Using a regression model to predict the solar energy potential based on various factors. Models may include linear regression, polynomial regression, Support Vector Regression, or Random Forest Regression.

### Heating Energy Estimation

We will estimate the amount of energy spent on heating:
- Analyzing the gas usage data and the electricity usage data.
- Estimating how much solar energy is required to offset the heating requirements.
- Using a regression model similar to the one used in the solar energy potential analysis to predict future heating energy requirements.

### Geographical and Neighborhood Analysis

We will analyze the data based on geographical location and neighborhood characteristics:
- Grouping the data by neighborhood and calculating summary statistics for each group.
- Using a clustering algorithm such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, or other suitable methods to group houses based on these factors.

## Conclusion

This project will provide valuable insights into home energy use and solar potential. The results could inform strategies for promoting solar energy adoption and improving energy efficiency. The methodologies outlined above will ensure a rigorous and systematic analysis of the data. The project will adhere to best practices for reproducible research, including thorough documentation and version control.
